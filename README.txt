Team Unseelie - Jay Weil (jmweil@wpi.edu) and Owen Lacey (oelacey@wpi.edu)

Game written in Visual Studio on windows. Compiles and runs via visual studio.

game.cpp contains a main function that runs the game, loading assets and creating the basic objects needed.
The basic object and event handling code is based on the example from saucer shoot (due to the similarity in needed functions).

There are sprites designed but not implemented into the game just yet. The current game uses some placeholders.
